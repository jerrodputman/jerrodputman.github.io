I am a programmer, with over 14 years of experience developing games. I worked in the console game industry for a while before moving into the mobile arena. Currently, I mostly do native iOS development for my full-time job, but console games and game development still manages to excite and entice me. My wife [Shannon][shannonkay] and I have a beautiful daughter named [Guinevere][fairguinevere]. We live in Orange County, California.
