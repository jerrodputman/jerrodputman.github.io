At the end of 2013, I officially closed the virtual doors of Tiny Tim Games, LLC, my former independent game business. I had a few reasons for doing this: We hadn't released a game in nearly four years, I didn't want to continue providing support for games that weren't making money, and I didn't want to pay the California state LLC tax ($800) for a business that I wasn't really running anymore.

I always knew I would eventually give it another go, but I needed some time off (and a full-time job for stability). I got settled in at my new job, and my family and I even moved into a new place.

Then, about a month ago, I started playing with Unity's 4.6 beta, which has the new Unity GUI system (uGUI). I figured the easiest way to learn it would be to redo one of my previous games. I chose *Word Monkey* as it was the most painful game I had made in terms of UI.

To make a long story short, uGUI is awesome. I'm actually making almost the entire game using uGUI elements. At some point I realized that I could completely finish the game in a couple of months and have it ready for submission. So I decided it was time to open up a new business.

# Choosing a Company Structure

For Tiny Tim Games, we eventually formed it as an LLC, mostly due to the ease at which it was to manage it. I'd heard and seen many other indies talk about structuring their business as an S-Corp, so I figured it would be a good thing to research.

In the end, I still decided to go with an LLC, as there is a lot of formality involved with operating an S-Corp. I'm already not the best when it comes to paperwork, so I didn't want to compound the problem, especially since the only owners (and workers) would be myself and my wife.
